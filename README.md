pnpm-workspaces monorepo — one git repo holding an Astro client and a NestJS
server side by side.

## Structure

```text
/
├── apps/
│   ├── client/   Astro front end   (dev :4321)
│   └── server/   NestJS API        (dev :3000)
├── packages/     shared libraries (none yet)
├── package.json      workspace root — scripts only, no app deps
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── pnpm-lock.yaml    the single lockfile for the whole repo
```

## Requirements

- Node `>=22.12.0`
- pnpm 11 (`corepack enable`)

## Getting started

```sh
pnpm install   # from the repo root
pnpm dev       # runs client and server together
```

## Commands

Run from the repo root:

| Command                          | Action                                  |
| :------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                   | Install every workspace's dependencies  |
| `pnpm dev`                       | Start client and server in parallel     |
| `pnpm dev:client`                | Start only the Astro dev server         |
| `pnpm dev:server`                | Start only the Nest dev server (watch)  |
| `pnpm build`                     | Build every app                         |
| `pnpm check`                     | Type-check every app                    |
| `pnpm --filter <app> <script>`   | Run a script in one app                 |
| `pnpm --filter <app> add <pkg>`  | Add a dependency to one app             |

`<app>` is `client` or `server`.

## Server

The API answers on `http://localhost:3000`, with a health probe:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3000/health   # {"status":"ok"}
```

Override the port with the `PORT` environment variable.

## Adding a shared package

Shared code goes in `packages/*` (already matched by `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and
is consumed with `"workspace:*"`. Apps must never import each other by relative
path.
